Hello! This is the files I use for me creating a bunch of different engineering professors' websites for the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCF. Currently I'm working on Piotr Kulik and Sazadur Rahman's websites, with more to come through the summer and the fall.

Currently built using HTML, CSS, and JS. But eventually will move to React towards the end of summer.
