                        <p>In the LIMB@UCF, we want to do excellent and ethical science to improve our understanding of the brain and use that understanding to propose technological innovations that increase the functional ability and independence of older adults and individuals who have experienced trauma or injury to their nervous system. To do this, we need people to be passionate about what we are doing and come to work in a good frame of mind to get it done. We aim to be nurturing, challenging, and stimulating to the students, respectful of their personal lives, and caring and respectful of the participants in our studies.</p>
